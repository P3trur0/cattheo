This repository contains my ~~**[Scala]**~~ [**Agda**] implementations of Bartosz Milewski's Category Theory for Programmers challenges.  
The blog posts by Bartosz are available [here](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/).

### Challenges
Here I'll track all the challenges implemented while reading the blog posts.  

- challenges from [**Category: The Essence of Composition**](https://github.com/P3trur0/cattheo/tree/master/challenges/post_1.md)

### Acknowledgements

I am grateful to (@marcosh)[https://github.com/marcosh] because he suggested to use a programming language I am not really familiar with for the implementations of the exercises to make them more challenging.
